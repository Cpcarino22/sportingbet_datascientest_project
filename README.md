Introduction
CONTEXT
Integration into your business:
If your business is in the tennis industry or you offer services related to tennis, such as coaching or equipment sales, the ATP matches dataset can be useful for market research, trend analysis, and player performance evaluation. For example, dataset can be used to identify popular tournaments and players, analyze the popularity of different court surfaces, and track player rankings over time. This information can help make informed business decisions, such as which tournaments to sponsor or which players to hire for endorsement deals.

Technical point of view:
The ATP matches dataset contains data on more than 50,000 matches played between 2000 and March 2018, including information on the players, tournament, surface, and outcome. The dataset is in a structured format and can be easily imported into a variety of data analysis tools, such as Python, R, and Excel. It can be used for various data analysis tasks, including data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

Economic point of view:
The ATP matches dataset can be valuable for businesses in the tennis industry as well as for sports betting companies. By analyzing the historical data, businesses can make informed decisions about where to allocate their resources and make profitable investments. For example, sports betting companies can use the dataset to develop betting strategies and adjust their odds based on the performance of individual players and tournaments.

Scientific point of view:
The ATP matches dataset can be used by researchers to study various aspects of tennis, including player performance, tournament outcomes, and the effects of different court surfaces on player performance. Researchers can also use the dataset to test hypotheses and develop new theories about the game of tennis. The dataset can be used in conjunction with other data sources, such as weather data and player demographics, to perform more complex analyses and gain deeper insights into the game.

OBJECTIVE
This ATP matches dataset is to provide a comprehensive data source for analyzing professional men's tennis matches played between 2000 and March 2018. The dataset includes information on the location, tournament, date, court, surface, round, best of, winner, loser, rank, sets won, and odds for each match.

This dataset can contribute to the understanding of the performance and trends in men's professional tennis over an 18-year period. It can also help identify patterns and correlations between various factors such as location, court type, and player rankings. This dataset can be used by analysts, researchers, and tennis enthusiasts for various purposes such as player performance analysis, match prediction, and trend analysis.

POTENTIAL ISSUES
Potential issues with the dataset that needs to check:

Missing values: As we saw earlier, some columns have a significant number of missing values. Depending on the analysis you want to do, you may need to deal with these missing values.

Outliers: There may be outliers in the data, which could affect the results of your analysis. You may need to identify and handle these outliers appropriately.

Data quality: It's important to ensure that the data is accurate and reliable. This could include checking for typos or other errors in the data.

Data consistency: The data should be consistent across all columns. For example, if the tournament name is spelled differently in different rows, this could cause issues when trying to group or analyze the data.

Data integrity: Ensure that the data has not been tampered with or altered in any way.

Data format: The data should be in a consistent format across all columns. For example, if the date is not in a standardized format, this could make it difficult to perform analyses based on date.

Data relevance: Ensure that the data is relevant to the analysis you want to perform. For example, if you are analyzing data from a specific time period, ensure that the data is from that time period.

NEED TO CONVERT
SPLIT the column for MONTH, DAY, YEAR
Date Type should be INT64 and not OBJECT

MISSING VALUES
Wsets, Lsets, PSW, PSL, B365W, and B365L columns are non-null values but has missing values maybe because some matches may not have had data available for those particular fields.

CATEGORICAL VARIABLES CONVERT TO NUMERICAL VARIABLES
Location, Tournament, Series, and Comment columns are categorical variables.
Possible methods to use: one-hot encoding, label encoding, and target encoding.

Methods:
There are several methods to do this:

One-hot encoding: This method creates new binary columns for each unique category in the original categorical column. For example, if we have a "Location" column with the categories "Adelaide", "Doha", and "Dubai", one-hot encoding would create three new columns: "Location_Adelaide", "Location_Doha", and "Location_Dubai". The value in each new column would be 1 if the corresponding category is present for that row, and 0 otherwise.

Label encoding: This method assigns a unique numerical value to each category in the original categorical column. For example, if we have a "Location" column with the categories "Adelaide", "Doha", and "Dubai", label encoding would assign the values 0, 1, and 2 to these categories, respectively.

Target encoding: This method replaces each category in the original categorical column with the mean target value for that category. For example, if we have a "Location" column and the target variable is the probability of a team winning a match, target encoding would replace each location with the mean probability of winning for matches played in that location.
